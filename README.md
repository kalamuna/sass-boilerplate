Generally following [Atomic design principles](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

Aiming to acheive a drupal friendlyness while raising our heads high via [fugly selector method](https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/decouple-design-styleguide-driven-drupal-development)

More to come.
